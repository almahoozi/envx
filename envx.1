NAME
       envx - Manage encrypted values in .env files and execute programs with decrypted environments

SYNOPSIS
       envx [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       envx is a CLI tool for securely managing encrypted environment variables in .env files. It allows adding, retrieving, and modifying encrypted values, as well as executing programs with decrypted environments.

COMMANDS
       run [PROGRAM] [ARGUMENTS]...
              Runs the specified program with the decrypted .env file.

       add [VARIABLE=VALUE]...
              Encrypts and adds one or more variables to the .env file.
              Fails if the variable already exists.
              Options:
                -p, --print   Prints the encrypted variable without writing.

       set [VARIABLE=VALUE]...
              Encrypts and adds one or more variables to the .env file.
              Overwrites existing values instead of failing.
              Options:
                -p, --print   Prints the new encrypted variable instead of writing.

       remove [VARIABLE]...
              Removes one or more variables from the .env file, whether encrypted or not.

       get [VARIABLE]...
              Retrieves one or more variables, decrypting if necessary.

       env
              Decrypts all variables and prints a formatted .env file, removing comments and extra spaces.
              Options:
                -w, --write   Overwrites the .env file with formatted contents.

       decrypt
              Prints the .env file as is, but with decrypted values.
              Options:
                -w, --write   Overwrites the file with decrypted values.

       encrypt
              Prints the .env file as is, but encrypts any unencrypted variables.
              Options:
                -w, --write   Overwrites the file with encrypted values.

       load
              (Planned for future versions) Loads environment variables from an external source (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) into an encrypted .env file.

       config [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]
              Manages global and per-project configurations.
              Subcommands:
                migrate       Migrates encryption keys/settings.
                export        Exports the encryption key or certificate.
                import        Imports an encryption key or certificate.
                set KEY VALUE Sets a configuration value.
                get KEY       Retrieves a configuration value.
                remove KEY    Removes a configuration value.
                list          Displays the current configuration.

       track [FILE] [OPTIONS]
              Manually adds a file to tracking for migration or key rotation.
              Options:
                --id=<xxx>    Assigns a custom ENVX_ID to the file.
                -w, --write   Enables automatic movement detection via ENVX_ID.

       untrack [FILE]
              Removes a file from tracking.

       list-files
              Lists all tracked .env files.

       rotate-key
              Re-encrypts all secrets with a new encryption key.
              Options:
                --new-key=<file>  Uses a specified new key instead of generating one.
                --backup=<file>   Creates a backup of the old .env file before re-encryption.

       migrate [OPTIONS]
              Moves secrets and encryption keys to another machine.
              Options:
                --export-key      Exports the key if permitted.
                --import-key <file>  Imports an encryption key.
                --file <file>     Specifies an alternative .env file to migrate.
                --no-key          Skips key export/import (manual transfer required).

OPTIONS
       -n, --name <name>
              Looks for .env.<name> instead of .env.

       -f, --file <path>
              Uses a specific file instead of the default.

       -w, --write
              Overwrites the target file where applicable.

CONFIGURATION
       - Global config stored in:
         - Linux/Mac: $HOME/.config/envx/config.json
         - Windows: %APPDATA%\envx\config.json
       - Per-project config stored in .envx/config.json within the project directory.
       - Config options:
         - Default file resolution chain (.env.{x} then .env).
         - Auto-write mode (-w enabled by default).
         - Key management (global vs. per-project keys).
         - External key sources (AWS KMS, Vault, etc.).
         - Auto-tracking (can be disabled).
         - File movement detection via ENVX_ID.

ENCRYPTION & KEY MANAGEMENT
       - Default: Auto-generated key stored in OS keychain (MacOS-only in v1).
       - YubiKey support via PIV mode.
       - Password-based encryption available (requires password on each run).
       - Optional password caching agent.
       - ECC (256-bit or 384-bit) default, RSA (2048-bit min, 3072-bit preferred) as alternative.
       - No fallback if external key sources are unreachable.

FILE TRACKING & MIGRATION
       - envx automatically tracks encrypted files.
       - Users can manually track/untrack files.
       - ENVX_ID allows deduplication and movement detection (opt-in).

EXIT STATUS
       0   Successful execution.
       1   Error occurred.
